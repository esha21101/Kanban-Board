# [Kanban Board Application](https://main.d2nq9mz8ggbsl4.amplifyapp.com)

This is a dynamic Kanban board app built with React JS, designed to make task management a breeze! It integrates seamlessly with the [API](https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment) from Quicksell, letting users fully customize their board view. You can effortlessly group tasks by status, user, or priority, and sort them by priority or title for a more streamlined experience. Plus, your personalized board layout stays intact, even after a page refresh. Say goodbye to resetting your viewâ€”this app has got you covered!
